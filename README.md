# Marketing-Analytics
This repository shows the R codes I created for a marketing analytics course I followed.  \

The two tasks are presumable done for the marketing team of a charity organization. 

## Task 1 - Solicitation Plan 

Predicting when and how frequently a donor donates and hence, based on the donor behavious what is the best time to solicit them.   
The objective is to solicit a donor ignoring the short term resluts and focussing on the long term value and hence, prevent churn.  

I used BTYD in R to predict frequency and probability of a donor being active; and used XGBoost to predict the amount of the donations by the donor.  

## Task 2 - Predictive modelling excercise. 

The goal is to predict who is likely to make a donation to the charity for the fundraising campaign and how much money they are likely to give if they do (€). By combining these two predictions (% & €), an expected revenue from each individual will be obtained.

If the predicted revenue exceeds the solicitation costs, the customer is recommended to be solicited.
